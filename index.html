  <p>Since I was a little child I have always loved this dish. My mum used to cook it for me often in the evenings when she didn't have a lot of time, and also because I always asked her to!<p>
  <p>This is a dish with cheese, heavy cream, and bacon. But it is so good! Silky pasta in a delicious bacony creamy sauce. And kids love it! Which is always a winner when you want to prepare something simple and fast when they're getting hungry.</p>
  <p> Let's get ready!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For four people we need:</p>
  </div>
  <div>
  <p><ul id="lista">
     <li>340 g pasta</li>
     <li>120 ml cream</li>
     <li>1/2 onion</li>
     <li>salt</li>
     <li> 1 spoon olive oil</li>
     <li>grated parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  </div>

    <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>First you need to pour the olive oil in a frying pan with high heat. Then when it is ready you can pour the bacon.
            <p>I usually use the one already cut in cubes, but you can use the sliced bacon too. Low a little the heat and wait until the meat becomes a bit darker.</p>
            <p><em><b>Be careful though and don't let it burn!</b></em></p> </li>
        <li> Now you can pour the cream and mix a little. Keep the heat at medium and wait until the cream becomes a bit more dense and starts bubbling. 
            <p>If you notice it is getting too dry you can use a little bit more of cream or if you have finished it just a spoon of milk.</p>
            <p>When it's ready just switch off the heat and put the frying pan to a side where is cold. You can decide to prepare it in advance since it doesn't matter if it becomes cold.</p>
        <li> On another heating space you can put a pan with water, put how much salt you're used to and then wait until it starts boiling</li>
        <li><p>Put the pasta in the water and wait for the amount of minutes written on the instructions. Usually I like to use fusilli or farfalle type of pasta, but there are many people who use spaghetti or something else. </p>
            <p>It is up to you and your preferences!</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the pasta is ready drain it and pour it in the pan with the cream and start mixing it. If you prepared the cream in advance just put it back on the heat where you were cooking the pasta so that it can become warm again.</p></li>
        <li><p> Now serve the pasta and put as much grated cheese as desired for each person and enjoy!</p></li>
            </ol>

    Usually people tend to change the recipe with other foods they like. You can add maybe just some pepper, or change a bit and put some vegetables in it (like zucchini, peas, etc.). In case just cook with the bacon before putting the cream in it.
